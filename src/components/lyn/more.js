      I create favoring human behavior need and desire; and for the unique exhilaration when using intuitive & useful things. A student of UI principles and conventions, I design mobile-first & responsively, and greatly value an iterative web/UI design process.

      I love to design and code, am a fast learner, and know what it means to be a professional and teammate. I believe in learning on the fly, staying open to creative possibilities, and trust that remaining grounded in the desires of the people I engage, ideas will develop into solutions.
